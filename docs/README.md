## What is PixlCam?

A set of 2D cameras for games written in TypeScript:

- A [simple camera](./api/classes/ScreenCamera.md) for drawing in screen-space
- A [camera that follows](./api/classes/FollowingCamera.md) your player smoothly
- An [influenced camera](./api/classes/InfluencedCamera.md) inspired by the [camera from Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet](http://michelgagne.blogspot.com/2012/07/itsp-camera-explained.html).

You'll get a projection and a model-view matrix ready to use, but there are also getters if your setup can't specify a camera matrix.
