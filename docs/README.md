## What is PixlCam?

A set of 2D cameras for games written in TypeScript:

- A [basic camera](./guide/basic-camera.md) you can use for simple stuff
- A [screen camera](./guide/screen-camera.md) for drawing in screen-space coordinates
- A [camera that follows](./guide/following-camera.md) your player smoothly
- An [influenced camera](./guide/influenced-camera.md) inspired by the [camera from Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet](http://michelgagne.blogspot.com/2012/07/itsp-camera-explained.html).

You'll get a projection and a model-view matrix ready to use, but there are also getters if your setup can't specify a camera matrix.
